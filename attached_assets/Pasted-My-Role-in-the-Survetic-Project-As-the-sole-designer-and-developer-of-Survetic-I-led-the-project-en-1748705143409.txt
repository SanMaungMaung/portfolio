My Role in the Survetic Project
As the sole designer and developer of Survetic, I led the project end-to-end ‚Äî from idea validation and UI/UX design to full-stack implementation and deployment. I architected a scalable, production-ready survey platform that demonstrates my ability to build robust, modern web applications that solve real business problems.

üß† Product Design & Planning
Conceptualized and defined the product vision and feature set to address the limitations of fragmented survey tools.

Designed the user flow, wireframes, and interface components using a mobile-first approach to ensure intuitive navigation and usability across devices.

üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Development
Engineered the UI using React 18 with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and component reusability.

Built a drag-and-drop survey builder with real-time previews, using Framer Motion, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS for fluid animations and responsive layouts.

Integrated Recharts for real-time analytics visualization, and ensured seamless user interactions with TanStack Query and React Hook Form + Zod.

üîí Backend & Authentication
Developed a secure and scalable backend using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL for structured data storage.

Implemented a modular authentication system using Passport.js, featuring secure sessions, email verification, bcrypt hashing, and role-based access control.

üìä Analytics & Performance
Designed and implemented a real-time analytics dashboard to track survey performance, device usage, and geographic data.

Applied advanced performance strategies such as code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking to optimize load times and resource efficiency.

üì± Responsive UX
Used CSS Grid/Flexbox and collapsible UI patterns to ensure 100% mobile compatibility.

Developed responsive admin interfaces with dynamic layouts and optimized navigation for smaller screens.

‚öôÔ∏è DevOps & Deployment
Configured build tools with Vite and ESBuild for lightning-fast development cycles.

Deployed the application on Vercel, utilizing environment-based configuration and CI/CD workflows via GitHub.

üß© Key Contributions Summary
Full-stack development: Built everything from scratch ‚Äî UI, APIs, database schema, authentication, and analytics logic.

UX-first thinking: Prioritized user-centric design with responsive, accessible interfaces.

Production readiness: Delivered a stable, maintainable, and scalable platform with automated deployment.

Problem-solving mindset: Solved complex challenges in mobile responsiveness, real-time data handling, and secure authentication architecture.

This project reflects not only my technical proficiency but also my ability to independently own and deliver a complete digital product ‚Äî from concept to launch. It showcases my passion for clean architecture, user experience, and creating solutions that bring measurable value to users and organizations.
