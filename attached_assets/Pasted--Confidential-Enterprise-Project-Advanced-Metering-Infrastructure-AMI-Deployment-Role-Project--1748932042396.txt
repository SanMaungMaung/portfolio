Role: Project Manager & Senior Front-End Developer Client: Myanmar Electricity Sector  Duration: 2017 – 2025 Status: Nationwide rollout completed and operational
🔒 Note
This project is protected under a long-term non-disclosure agreement. Therefore, source code, detailed architecture, and visuals cannot be shared. The following summary reflects only publicly generalizable aspects of the project.

🧭 Project Overview
Led the national-scale implementation of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) system that replaced manual meter reading and enabled real-time, secure, and remote energy data acquisition. The AMI system formed the foundation for the country's first fully automated billing and energy usage monitoring platform.

🎯 Key Contributions
🔹 Project Management
* Directed cross-departmental collaboration among hardware engineers, embedded system developers, software engineers, and governmental stakeholders.
* Managed rollout across multiple townships, coordinating deployment logistics, testing, and stakeholder training.
* Acted as the central point of communication between international hardware suppliers, local utility staff, and software teams.
🔹 Front-End Development
* Designed and built front-end tools to:
    * Visualize live meter data and grid health across multiple zones
    * Monitor communication status of thousands of remote meters
    * Administer firmware update rollouts and diagnostics
* Developed admin dashboards with filters for township, ward, and meter status levels.
🔹 System Integration
* Enabled seamless data exchange between smart meters and billing servers.
* Worked closely with hardware engineers to develop AMI APIs and ensure compliance with DLMS/COSEM protocols.
* Integrated warning and alert mechanisms for abnormal readings, tampering detection, and data sync failures.

⚡ Impact Highlights
* Over 2.7 million+ smart meters connected nationwide.
* Enabled real-time consumption monitoring and remote meter disconnections/reconnections.
* Drastically reduced Non-Technical Losses (NTL) through automated detection of anomalies and tampering.
* Improved energy planning and load balancing via accurate consumption data.

🔐 Technologies Used
React, Redux, TypeScript, Map APIs (for geo-visualization), WebSocket / MQTT for real-time data, REST APIs, DLMS/COSEM Protocol, Custom Device Management Tools, Secure TLS Data Transport, Grafana (internal use)

🧠 Special Features
* AMI Health Dashboard: Live monitoring of meter communication uptime and data packet success rates.
* Meter Management Tools: UI for linking, replacing, and updating smart meters by township.
* Anomaly Detection Interface: Highlighted suspicious consumption patterns and communication outages.
