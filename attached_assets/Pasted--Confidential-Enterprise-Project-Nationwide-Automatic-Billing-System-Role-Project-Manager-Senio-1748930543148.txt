🔒 Note
Due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), I cannot publicly share the source code, UI screenshots, or internal implementation details. This case study offers a generalized overview of my responsibilities and the impact of the system.

🧭 Project Overview
Led the design, development, and implementation of a scalable Automatic Billing System (ABS) integrated with Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) across multiple Myanmar electricity corporations (YESC, ESE, MESC). This platform replaced the traditional manual billing process, enabling:

Automatic meter readings

Real-time billing and accounting

Online payments via local bank integrations

Remote enforcement for late payments

Centralized auditing & compliance reports

🎯 Key Contributions

Oversaw cross-functional teams of developers, testers, and infrastructure engineers across 3 corporations.

Coordinated with international experts for security, scalability, and infrastructure guidance.

Delivered on strict deadlines imposed by governmental clients during the transition to smart metering.

🔹 Front-End Development
Architected and developed modern, responsive interfaces for the billing dashboard and reporting tools using React and TypeScript.

Created role-based access controls and admin panels for township-level management.

Built dashboards to generate real-time analytics (tariff ledgers, Form 7/43/76/243/etc.), improving audit transparency.

🔹 Integrations
Integrated with various smart meters using industry protocols (e.g., DLMS/COSEM).

Collaborated with backend and DevOps teams to ensure smooth communication with APIs and secure data flows.

Helped develop an online payment gateway connected to major local banks for seamless bill collection.

💡 Impact Highlights
Deployed across 85 townships in Myanmar.

Reduced billing cycle from weeks to hours.

Achieved over 90% accuracy in meter readings and automated calculations.
